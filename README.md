**Warning: this script performs `eval` on arbitrary input that you do not control. I am confident that it is still safe with all the processing that I put in (confident enough that I am using it myself), but it still is a _tiny_ security risk. Use at your own risk. I am not responsible for anything that happens from you using this script.**
